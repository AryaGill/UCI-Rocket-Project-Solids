# 🚀 Azula – UCI Rocket Project Solids (2024)

**Azula** is the 2024 competition rocket developed by the UCI Rocket Project Solids, with contributions from all subteams: **Launch Vehicle, Propulsion, Avionics, Payload, and Operations**. It represents the culmination of months of design, testing, and integration — resulting in our most precise and successful launch to date.
